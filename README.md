# :information_source: About

AlgoExpert's Mobile App was developed using Facebook's <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native">React Native</a> framework and <a href="https://expo.io/">Expo tools</a>. It's objective is to deliver almost the same experience of using the platform at a web browser. The user can do the same things, except coding. But to compensate it, the app brings some new features, as favorite questions.

# :iphone: Running

Please install the <a href="https://expo.io/tools#client">Expo Tools</a> at your phone and scan the QR Code bellow to run the app.

All the development proccess until here was tested just in <b>iOS devices</b>, so I can't guarantee a properly behavior at Android devices yet. But feel free to try it yourself.
